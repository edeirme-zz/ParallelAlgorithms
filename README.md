ParallelAlgorithms
==================


Programs created for the purpose of the Parallel Algorithms course in my Master's Degree.

The programs are written in C using Mpich. The main of those programs is to focus on parallel programming.

Program prefixsummaxsbsq: Implement the prefix sum algorithm in order to calculate the prefix sum maximum
subsequence of a 1d array.

Program arraymapping: Divide a bitwise array into strips. Replace the bit '1' with a char element in such
a way that all the nearby '1' elements (top, down, left, right) are replaced by the same character.
